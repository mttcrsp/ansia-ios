# ansia-ios

Ansia is an iPhone app I developed to keep up with Italian news and test out different technologies and approaches to iOS development. I do not own the rights to the content the app displays, nor the fonts it uses. This project is shared for educational and reference purposes.

While working on this app, I was particularly interested in gaining hands-on experience on two specific topics:
- recreating a real-world complex user interface using [Texture](https://github.com/texturegroup/Texture);
- building a UIKit-based application using the [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).
